## Why Emacs?

Emacs is more than just a text editor. It's essentially a hacker's Swiss army knife with an infinite number of slots for new tools to add.

## What i use it for

To list a few:

- IDE/text editing
- file management
- terminal
- pdf viewer
- note-taking
- obsidian-like "second brain" note-taking
- music player
- calculator
- calendar + scheduler/agenda

## Notable features

Some neat features of my setup:

- Helix/Kakoune-like modal editing
- Elpaca package manager for asynchronous, non-blocking installations
